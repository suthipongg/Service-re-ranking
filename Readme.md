## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

**Improve Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Re-ranking Model** aims to enhance the relevance and quality of outputs in RAG systems. By integrating a re-ranking model, we refine the initial retrieval results, ensuring the most relevant information is used for generation.

### Key Objectives
- **Enhanced Retrieval Accuracy:** Select the most contextually appropriate documents.
- **Optimized Generation Quality:** Produce coherent and relevant responses.
- **Efficiency and Scalability:** Ensure the model is efficient for large-scale use.

### Approach
Our method involves:
1. **Document Retrieval:** Initial retrieval of relevant documents.
2. **Re-ranking:** Scoring and ranking these documents for relevance.
3. **Augmented Generation:** Using top-ranked documents for final response generation.

### Benefits
- **Improved Response Relevance**
- **Reduction in Noise**
- **Enhanced User Satisfaction**

This project is ideal for those in NLP looking to improve RAG systems.

## üåü Features

- **Re-rank Sentences:** Prioritizes the most contextually relevant sentences for improved accuracy.
- **Model Warm-up:** Enhances performance through an initial warm-up phase.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- [GitHub Project](https://github.com/suthipongg/Service-re-ranking.git)
- [Re-Ranking Model](https://huggingface.co/Pongsasit/mod-th-cross-encoder) (Pongsasit/mod-th-cross-encoder)
- [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/)

### Installing
